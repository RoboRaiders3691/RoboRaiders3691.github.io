            Once you have Phoenix installed, you can use it to add motors and sensors to your program.
            If nessesary, you may reference the <a href="importantlinks.html">important links</a> to find
            documentation on everything Phoenix can do, and it should be completely up to date.  

            To add a motor, you first need to know your motor type.  Our team, 3691, uses Krakens, which are 
            marked as TalonFX type motors.
