            If Phoenix libraries(the libraries where all the motor commands are) are already installed, you may
            skip this step.

            If Phoenix libraries are not installed already, this tutorial will hopefully be helpful.

            To begin, click on the WPILIB symbol in the top right corner of your screen and search for Manage
            Vendor Libraries.  Then, if you already have the library downloaded, select Install New Libraries(offline).
            If you dont have the library downloaded, aquire a link and enter it into Install New Libraries(online).
            You can uninstall libraries by selecting Manage Current Libraries, and you can update it by checking for 
            updates either online or offline.
        </p>
        <p>
            If all is successful, congradulations!  You have now installed Phoenix and can use any files from the 
            Phoenix libraries.  Select the next program to continue, or ask Mr Connor any questions.  
            You can also contact me on Discord at thecounterteamer.
