            To start programming, open the current version of the WPILIB VSCode on your computer.  
            Currently, the correct libraries should be installed.

        </p>
        <p>
            To create a new project, click on the WPILIB symbol in the bar in the top right corner of the screen, and
            find the command to create a new project.  Set the project type to template, cpp, and then timed robot.
            Select the folder for the year to put your project in, or create a new folder if there is not a current folder.
            Then enter a project name of your choosing, and the team number 3691, and click generate project.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            Once your project has been created, you can go to src > main > cpp to find robot.cpp, and src > main > include
            to find robot.h.  Robot code will go in robot.cpp, and all variable, sensor, and motor declarations, as well
            as subsystems should be declared in robot.h.  
        </p>
